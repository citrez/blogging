Hi, welcome to my blog!
I'm a maths graduate now working as a data scientist in the city of London. 
I'll be using this blog to write up topics that i find interesting, or just code that I find elegant and occasionally just general musings. Feel free to leave a comment beneath my posts a get involved. 




## About my blog

This blog is just as much for me as for you. Don't get my wrong, im glad you're here. Make uyourself comfortable, take a look around and enjoy. But the advantages of me methodically  writting down ideas, methods and tricks, cannot be overstated. 

[**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
