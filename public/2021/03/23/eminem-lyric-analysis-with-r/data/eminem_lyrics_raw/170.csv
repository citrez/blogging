Shady, we're back
Nothin' can stop and nothin' can change it
You better just make new living arrangements
If you think you're the top and king of the castle
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is, I'm best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name no, ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z
Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe they'll name me
Somewhere down at the bottom right after AZ
Or say ""he ripped that Biggie verse or that Jay-Z
Yo, his verses were crazy on that Renegade beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And I all I hear is pop tunes come on the rad-I-o
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily""
And that very well may be the same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big-big-big-big-b-baby
So maybe the 80s made me crazy, I been tryna get my weight
Up since the Ace Slim Shady gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately my stakes get better each day, replay my relay race
When I was chasin' the a fey at 18, 8 years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream so
Shady (Stat Quo!), we're back
This is what I eat, sleep, and breath and feed my kids would it fulfill all my family needs (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block, fought with my rocks and squeeze
Critics expecting me to under achieve
I just deal with the hate I receive by rollin' back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze I bring him right to his knees?
And tell him suck my dick, take a bow and leave with a sack full of unmarked cheese, I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed to be Gs and claim they runnin' shit, nigga I run me, I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me, that same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be asking where I be, dawg I'm out in Hawaii, don't like it drink my pee
Record song for the Detox LP, feet don't fail he, niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Bellvee?
I'm 'a die wealthy, boss in the game, what the fuck they goin' tell me, A-Town's entrée, Aftermath Shady
Shady (Bobby Creek!), we're back
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check, pimp for what it's worth, I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know 'bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified 'till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em, 'cause I'm with him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
(None of them) stand a chance, at the dance without a bowtie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a chauffeur because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the epitome
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga, I'm just living me
We the reason for the season
So I'm breezing through the track, nigga
Shady
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
'Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth, to the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a Midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way, I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected getting weight from MS 13
With S.K.'s, A.R.'s and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real, with a strap
On Pro-sac, Ds and E-Pills, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga
Shady, we're back
Ha, I told you we was back
What
Ha ha ha
