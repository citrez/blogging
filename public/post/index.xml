I think good data scientist should consider blogging Lets cut to the chase here, in no particular order these are the skills that blogging will help you with.
 ordering your thoughts
 reminding yourself of things you’ve forgotten you knew how to do
 finishing things.
 Communicating results to a non-technical audience.
 practicing reproducibilty
  -incentive to stay curious. I’m more likely to go that extra mile to check out an interesting sounding package if i think it could be the makings of an interesting blog post.</description>
