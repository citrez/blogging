      <description>Text Mining with Eminem Text mining promises a lot. The ability to get a machine to understand the main topics in a text, or how positive the writer was about the subject could have applications as far reaching as law, analysing survey responces, stock market analysis. I usually favor simplicity over perfection. I’d rather have a 6/10 model that I can interpret and (crucially) explain than a 9/10 model that no one can get their head around.</description>
