      <description>Classic problem I stumbled across recently. I had a bunch of files in a directory, and i wanted to rename them all at once. Perfect excuse, i thought to myself, to check out the fs (in R) package for manipulating files.
What is a file what is a directory Good to be clear at the offset. A directory is where you store your files. They call it a tree structure, because it looks like a tree.</description>
