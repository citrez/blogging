<p>Zurich Insurance
July - September 2018</p>
<p>I worked as part of the data team within the Brexit project, which was responsible for managing the risks and gaining regulatory approval for the company’s post-brexit restructuring. Specifically, I was tasked with understanding the flow of data within Zurich UK in order to justify to the PRA that our processes were well managed. I documented the flow of data; how the granular customer data is stored and then manipulated it in order to calculate the final risk parameters. My work was focused on credit risk and expense risk. I received positive feedback for the clarity of my writing and the speed with which I understood the models.</p>

June - Sept 2017</p>
<p>I was selected for a competitive 10 week summer internship which included rotations within the Capital Modelling and Risk Framework teams. I communicated in-depth technical risk analysis to major stakeholders and met regularly with the Senior Managing Director to report on balancing profitability, growth and risk. I worked on calculating the solvency capital requirement (SCR) using the firm’s internal modeling software; this required high levels of quantitative and critical thinking. I also gained a strong introduction to econometric modelling, stochastic methods and computer programming.
Projects:
Delivered an hour presentation entitled “Risk Benchmarking between Global Insurance Firms”, to senior management - including the CRO. Topics included: Credit risk, Market risk and Operational risk. My manager gave positive feedback on my dynamic delivery and well-reasoned responses to questions.
Led a project to overhaul and improve the ERM webpage of AIG Europe. I re-engineered the content and formatting using input from colleagues.
Conducted a research project on the emerging risks within the insurance sector. Particular emphasis was given to topics such as Cyber risk, Brexit and Political instability.
Collaborated with Management Consulting firm ‘Oliver Wyman’ on an industry-wide Benchmarking exercise. I consulted with other departments to collate and organise firm-wide data. This exhibits my ability to work in a team to execute goals.
I was offered a full-time graduate role.</p>
