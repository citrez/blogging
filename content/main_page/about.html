<p>Hi, welcome to my blog!
I’m a maths graduate now working as a data scientist in the city of London.
I’ll be using this blog to write up topics that i find interesting, or just code that I find elegant and occasionally just general musings. Feel free to leave a comment beneath my posts a get involved.</p>

<h2>About my blog</h2>
<p>This blog is just as much for me as for you. Don’t get my wrong, im glad you’re here. Make uyourself comfortable, take a look around and enjoy. But the advantages of me methodically writting down ideas, methods and tricks, cannot be overstated.</p>
