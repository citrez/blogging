Yeah!
God damn!
Feels like a long time, don't it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!
Ha!
Shady Narcotics
It's the Re-Up!
Pussies
And we're back
Myself
D12
50 Cent
Obie Trice
Stat Quo
A-a-a-al-al-al-al-alchemist
And I would also like to introduce the two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
The other goes by the name of Ca$his from Orange County
And I think it's about time we just cut the bullshit. Let's go!
