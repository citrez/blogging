<p>:boom:</p>
<p>I think good data scientist should consider blogging
Lets cut to the chase here, in no particular order these are the skills that blogging will help you with.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>ordering your thoughts</p></li>
<li><p>finishing things.</p></li>
<li><p>Communicating results to a non-technical audience.</p></li>
<li><p>practicing reproducibilty</p></li>
</ul>
<p>-incentive to stay curious. I’m more likely to go that extra mile to check out an interesting sounding package if i think it could be the makings of an interesting blog post.</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting your name out there. If you know stuff, and you want other to know that you know stuff. Then you have two options</li>
</ul>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>constantly remind people how much you know by not so subtly hijack conversations to make that abundantly clear to everyone</li>
<li>Have a workbook of code/ blog where you can show evidence of things that you do and dont know, and allow anyone to browse at thier own leasure.</li>
</ol>
<p>i’m sure you’ll make the right choice</p>
<ul>
<li>Web developement. I see making a blog as my first, very tentative, exploration into the world of webdevelopment. I hope at the very least it will keep HTML and CSS fresh in my mind and think about how a website might be structured. There are lots of technologies involved in building websites, exposure to a few surely is no bad thing. Knowing the difference between a static and dynamic website, the file structure of a simple website</li>
</ul>
