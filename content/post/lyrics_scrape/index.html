<h1>Scraping lyrics</h1>
<p><img src="/images/logo1.png" /></p>
<p>Title puns aside, I’ll be using the <code>rvest</code> package to scrape all Eminem song lyrics from <a href="www.azlyrics.com">here</a></p>
<p>We will also need to clean up these columns using regex</p>
<p>Now that we have our function to get the lyrics <code>extract_lyrics_from_link</code> and <code>parse_lyrics</code> to clean it up, we can simply loop over the number of songs on the website, and save all the lyrics. Ahh, the satisfaction of running a loop…</p>
<p>Theres one more step i want to take before i run the loop, the last thing is for everything to work great for the first 200 songs, and then i get an error on the 201st song and i need to start the scrape again.
So i use this great function called <code>possibly()</code> from the <code>purrr</code> package, which i talk about in this blog post</p>
<p>This is one of those many moments where the tidyverse feel like it has the perfect function.
The purrr package has this useful function which applies my <code>possibly_extract_song_and_lyrics</code> function to each 36,37,38.. each of these functions return a dataframe, map_dfr sticks all those 395 mini dataframes together.</p>
<p>I saved each lyric file separately so i could do them on different days so as to be sympathetic to the server.</p>
<p>I then save all the songs locally, so i dont need to re download them every time
now lets clean everything up with a bunch of parsing functions for the messy song and lyrics columns.</p>
<p>add album info. Ill add the album for the first song in the album, and then fill the rest in (downwards)</p>
