## Map

## Reduce

## Possibly, Safely, Quieitly

Possibly (along with similar function safelyt and quitely) are all functions which update the behaviour or other functions, so that if (read: when) something goes wrong in your code, R doesnt have a strop, and halt your code, loosing all your progress, you can decide its behavior. Here, i will tell R that if i dont get the lyrics, song dataframe i want, just retrun an empty one and add it to the list. The quiet = F just tells say "even though i dont want the error to ruin everything, I still want to hear about it".
```{r}

library(purrr)

`+`(1,1)

`possibly+` <- possibly(`+`,otherwise = '17',quiet = F) 
`possibly+`(1,'hi')

```
