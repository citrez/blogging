Hi, welcome to my blog!
I'm a maths graduate now working as a data scientist in the city of London. 
I'll be using this blog to write up topics that i find interesting, or just code that I find elegant and occasionally just general musings. Feel free to leave comments a get involved.

[**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) package. The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and modified by [Yihui Xie](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium).
